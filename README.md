# TEST
## Objective
A practicing repository for an effective journey @ 10 academy.

 Don't be bothered about the many comments in the code for am deliberately doing this to use it as a cheatsheet too, brilliant ha😉😉
 * I like being funny and creative while coding hope you'll like it too
 and guess what, 
 * * I wanted to write a journal daily and 
 * * be active on github so many times 
 but failed to do so because lack of discipline, you know inconsistency is a powerful disease
# so am gonna try 
* * to achieve both plans by creating a website to commit on precise daily messages
 for your information I don't have experience in website developing except for one copied from a lesson
### but if you don't take a step, you won't be able to run the marathon, just saying😅😅
# to be contonued...
